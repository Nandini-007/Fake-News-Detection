According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But the 8-0 ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company, Universal Health Services, and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the U.S. False Claims Act, which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded. The justices threw out a 2015 appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of Yarushka Rivera to sue Universal Health Services under the False Claims Act, but sent the case back to a lower court, meaning the suit could potentially still proceed. Rivera suffered a fatal seizure in 2009 at age 19 a mental health facility owned by the company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The lawsuit said the facility provided \\u201cgravely inadequate treatment\\u201d and used \\u201cunsupervised and unqualified personnel.\\u201d The ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower court\\u2019s expansive view of a company\\u2019s liability under the False Claims Act.  Roy Englert, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services\\u2019 lawyer, said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a \\u201cnew rigorous standard\\u201d for determining if the claims can move forward. Rivera\\u2019s parents, Julio Escobar and Carmen Correa, accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the Lawrence facility. The ruling \\u201caccepts the basic notion that fraudsters can\\u2019t provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability,\\u201d said David Frederick, the lawyer for Rivera\\u2019s family. Businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits, or disallow completely, lawsuits based on a federal contractor\\u2019s failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract.  The court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the government\\u2019s decision to make the payment to the company. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the parents \\u201cmay well have adequately pleaded a violation\\u201d of the fraud law, but added that the False Claims Act \\u201cis not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations.\\u201d The Obama administration had backed the parents. \",\n          \"You know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government, but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check? This right-wing patriot sure does!Among the thousands (upon thousands) of delusional anti-government comments the Bundy Ranch Facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a Oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right-wing nut job, who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it.You read that right, Daniel Brewer here can t spend the $300 he estimates he ll need to get to Oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet. Instead, he sends his  prayers  to the Oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement.First identified by blogger Jim Wright of Stonekettle.com, the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti-government extremists manage to live in. It may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government, but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case, a literal check every month so you can get by.This isn t the first time we ve seen right-wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government. During the ugly healthcare debate, one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed Obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare.  Medicare, you may remember, is a government healthcare plan. President Obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti-government government users. He recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by Fox News that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the ACA: I got a letter the other day from a woman. She said,  I don t want government-run health care. I don t want socialized medicine. And don t touch my Medicare.' Yikes.Our hapless anti-government militia sympathizer is, unsurprisingly, a conspiracy enthusiast as well. Scattered among pictures of his family, Brewer s Facebook page features dozens of right-wing memes and articles suggesting Muslims are imposing Sharia Law in America (they re not) and calls for Obama to resign (he isn t).The conclusion we can draw from this is clear: Many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it. They don t want to pay taxes (who does?) and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want, but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them.Feature image via SBNation\",\n          \"This pastor s church should be heavily taxed for this kind of political speech.Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is the first Jewish candidate to win a state primary in American history, pulling off the feat in New Hampshire last month in an incredible upset of Hillary Clinton.The self-described Democratic Socialist has excited crowds across the country with his vow to reign in Wall Street and end income inequality. Sanders is particularly popular with young people who see him as a desperately needed agent of change who can turn the system around and ensure a better future for all Americans.And it s because college students support him that one Christian televangelist is calling Sanders the next Adolf Hitler. You know, the Nazi Germany dictator who ordered the extermination of six million Jews during World War II. Yeah, that Hitler.During a sermon, disgraced pastor Jim Bakker openly compared Sanders to Hitler citing his socialist beliefs and claimed that if he s elected every American will be dead in a year. One of the most popular politicians right now is a socialist   And who is his biggest following? The young people of America, from the colleges. Maybe you understand a little bit what it felt like to live when Hitler was reigning and the church had to sit by and keep watching it and watching until millions, tens of millions   they had to build factories to kill people. All it takes is a couple bombs and all of America will be dead within a year, less than a year, just months. Bakkers audience, of course, consisted of a bunch of easily frightened old conservative white people.Here s the video via YouTube.There are many problems with Bakker s comparison.First of all, while young people are flocking to Sander s campaign, they are doing so on their own volition while Hitler and the Nazi Party actually went into schools to indoctrinate the German youth to get their support.Second, Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist, which is totally different from a National Socialist.As Sanders explained in November, Democratic Socialism  builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that,  This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.  It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Indeed, Sanders believes in  economic equality, universal health care, Wall Street reform, universal college education, paid family leave. In addition, Sanders also seeks  political reforms to limit the power of the wealthy so there is  democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations National Socialism, on the other hand, is a brutal and authoritarian fascist ideology practiced by the Nazis and other right-wing groups who believe in a racial hierarchy with whites at the top. Nazis support policies that push national power, demonize intellectualism, subjugate women, punish homosexuality, censor the free press, and are over-obsessed with Christianity among multiple other aspects you can find by clicking here.In NO way does National Socialism apply to Bernie Sanders. Jim Bakker would be thinking of THIS guy:Image via ImgurNeed proof of Trump s fascism? Well, there s the fact that he ll soon have his own version of Hitler s Brownshirts. Then there s the fact that legendary investigative journalist Carl Bernstein explained why Trump is a fascist. There s this excellent comparison made by the Daily Show. And there s the fact that neo-Nazis show up to support Trump at his rallies.Seriously, Jim Bakker is either oblivious to the real fascism being pushed by Trump or he supports Trump and just wants to shift the accusations of fascism to Sanders to protect the Republican front-runner. Either way, Bakker and his church should face steep taxes for engaging in political speech, especially the kind that pushes outright lies.Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pledged not to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Obama\\u2019s nomination on Wednesday of Merrick Garland, a centrist appeals court judge and former prosecutor, to the high court. Not all Senate Republicans want to block a vote on Garland. Senator Mark Kirk, locked in a tough re-election battle in Illinois, told WLS radio in Chicago that senators should \\u201cjust man up and cast a vote\\u201d on the Garland nomination. Kirk broke with McConnell last month, calling for hearings and a vote on Obama\\u2019s nominee. Conservative activists, however, vowed to fight in support of Republican leaders who insist that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office in January, make the appointment, hoping their party\\u2019s candidate wins. The conservative group Judicial Crisis Network said it would start a $2 million, three-week television, radio and digital advertising campaign in six states starting on Monday backing McConnell\\u2019s stance. Garland, 63, would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, on the nine-seat court. His appointment could tip the court leftward for the first time in decades. Liberal groups, including CREDO Action and MoveOn.org Civic Action, said they would rally at various locations on Monday calling on Senate Republicans to \\u201cDo Your Job\\u201d and put Garland through a full confirmation process.  One rally was planned for outside\\u00a0the Des Moines, Iowa office of Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would convene any hearings. The Iowa senator has said he opposes hearings but is open to meeting with Garland. The conservative ad campaign also is targeting Grassley. One senior Senate Republican aide, referring to pressures Grassley faces over the recess, speculated on the possibility he would return to Washington on April 4 more open to holding confirmation hearings. \\u201cTwo weeks in Iowa with Iowans screaming at him?\\u201d the aide said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated Vice President Joe Biden, a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, would lend his voice next week to administration efforts pressing for Garland\\u2019s confirmation.  While Earnest said Biden \\u201ccan be a pretty persuasive advocate,\\u201d Republicans have noted that Biden, as Judiciary Committee chairman in 1992, argued for postponing action on Supreme Court nominees during an election year. \",\n          \"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh police have detained several top leaders of the country s largest Islamist party in a crackdown against the opposition that the government blames for inciting militancy but which says it is being unfairly targeted.  Eight leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, including party chief Maqbul Ahmad and secretary general Shafiqur Rahman, were detained in Dhaka on Monday night, police said. They were formally arrested on Tuesday and ordered held on remand for 10 days while police investigate. The detentions followed information that the leaders were meeting  to plot and carry out some destructive activities , a senior police official said. Jamaat-e-Islami denied the allegations and called for demonstrations on Tuesday to protest. It said in a statement that its leaders were in an informal meeting.   The government is continuously arresting our innocent activists just to stay in power,  the party said. The detentions follow a years-long crackdown on the opposition by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s government and come ahead of general elections expected next year.  Opposition leaders deny any link to Islamic militants and say the crackdown can be traced to a bitter rivalry, which has long poisoned politics in the country, between Hasina s ruling Awami League and its main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), as well as Jamaat-e-Islami. Police and army commandos have killed more than 60 suspected militants and arrested hundreds since a deadly attack on a Dhaka cafe in July last year. Twenty-two people were killed, most of them foreigners.    \",\n          \"When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation.

RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.  AAmom (@AVD911) March 6, 2016And another @DebbieSchlussel you're actually racist scum  dmbrandon!! (@juiceDiem) March 6, 2016While this person made a rather helpful suggestion.@DebbieSchlussel let some light into your hateful heart   Chuck Daly (@ChuckDaly) March 6, 2016Former Will and Grace star Debra Messing drew attention to Schlussel s tweet, condemning it openly.Shame on you https://t.co/GPNI7EbqBs  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 6, 2016So Schlussel spent the rest of Sunday hate-tweeting Messing (getting no response) for the crime of speaking out against racism. Stay classy Schlussel.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pledged not to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Obama\\u2019s nomination on Wednesday of Merrick Garland, a centrist appeals court judge and former prosecutor, to the high court. Not all Senate Republicans want to block a vote on Garland. Senator Mark Kirk, locked in a tough re-election battle in Illinois, told WLS radio in Chicago that senators should \\u201cjust man up and cast a vote\\u201d on the Garland nomination. Kirk broke with McConnell last month, calling for hearings and a vote on Obama\\u2019s nominee. Conservative activists, however, vowed to fight in support of Republican leaders who insist that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office in January, make the appointment, hoping their party\\u2019s candidate wins. The conservative group Judicial Crisis Network said it would start a $2 million, three-week television, radio and digital advertising campaign in six states starting on Monday backing McConnell\\u2019s stance. Garland, 63, would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, on the nine-seat court. His appointment could tip the court leftward for the first time in decades. Liberal groups, including CREDO Action and MoveOn.org Civic Action, said they would rally at various locations on Monday calling on Senate Republicans to \\u201cDo Your Job\\u201d and put Garland through a full confirmation process.  One rally was planned for outside\\u00a0the Des Moines, Iowa office of Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would convene any hearings. The Iowa senator has said he opposes hearings but is open to meeting with Garland. The conservative ad campaign also is targeting Grassley. One senior Senate Republican aide, referring to pressures Grassley faces over the recess, speculated on the possibility he would return to Washington on April 4 more open to holding confirmation hearings. \\u201cTwo weeks in Iowa with Iowans screaming at him?\\u201d the aide said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated Vice President Joe Biden, a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, would lend his voice next week to administration efforts pressing for Garland\\u2019s confirmation.  While Earnest said Biden \\u201ccan be a pretty persuasive advocate,\\u201d Republicans have noted that Biden, as Judiciary Committee chairman in 1992, argued for postponing action on Supreme Court nominees during an election year. \",\n          \"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh police have detained several top leaders of the country s largest Islamist party in a crackdown against the opposition that the government blames for inciting militancy but which says it is being unfairly targeted.  Eight leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, including party chief Maqbul Ahmad and secretary general Shafiqur Rahman, were detained in Dhaka on Monday night, police said. They were formally arrested on Tuesday and ordered held on remand for 10 days while police investigate. The detentions followed information that the leaders were meeting  to plot and carry out some destructive activities , a senior police official said. Jamaat-e-Islami denied the allegations and called for demonstrations on Tuesday to protest. It said in a statement that its leaders were in an informal meeting.   The government is continuously arresting our innocent activists just to stay in power,  the party said. The detentions follow a years-long crackdown on the opposition by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s government and come ahead of general elections expected next year.  Opposition leaders deny any link to Islamic militants and say the crackdown can be traced to a bitter rivalry, which has long poisoned politics in the country, between Hasina s ruling Awami League and its main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), as well as Jamaat-e-Islami. Police and army commandos have killed more than 60 suspected militants and arrested hundreds since a deadly attack on a Dhaka cafe in July last year. Twenty-two people were killed, most of them foreigners.    \",\n          \"When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation. But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.  AAmom (@AVD911) March 6, 2016And another @DebbieSchlussel you're actually racist scum  dmbrandon!! (@juiceDiem) March 6, 2016While this person made a rather helpful suggestion.@DebbieSchlussel let some light into your hateful heart   Chuck Daly (@ChuckDaly) March 6, 2016Former Will and Grace star Debra Messing drew attention to Schlussel s tweet, condemning it openly.Shame on you https://t.co/GPNI7EbqBs  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 6, 2016So Schlussel spent the rest of Sunday hate-tweeting Messing (getting no response) for the crime of speaking out against racism.
